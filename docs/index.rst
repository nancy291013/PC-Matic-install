Understanding PC Matic
----------------------

Before diving into the installation process, it's important to know what PC Matic actually does. It’s not just your run-of-the-mill antivirus software. PC Matic uses a unique **whitelisting approach** for malware prevention, which blocks all unknown applications unless they’re proven safe. This makes it especially effective against new and evolving threats.

On top of that, it includes features like:

- Automated device maintenance
- Real-time protection
- Scheduled scans
- System optimization tools

In short, PC Matic is both a security solution and a performance enhancer.

- Active internet connection for download and setup

**For macOS:**
